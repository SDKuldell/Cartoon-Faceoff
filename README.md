# Cartoon-Faceoff

Cartoon Faceoff is a text-based game where each turn you can either, create a new character, attack a separate character, or upgrade one of your current characters. To attack a character, roll a 6-sided die. If it is a 4, 5, or 6, the attack succeeds and the defending character is destroyed. Otherwise, the defender survives. Attack upgrades increase the odds of a successful attack, and defense upgrades decrease the odds. You have a point for owning a character and for each upgrade they have, and if you destroy an opponent’s character, then you get 3 points. However, if someone runs out of characters, they lose 10 points. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins!

To play the game, put all of the .java files into one location, then compile and run StartGame.java. The game is text and line based. The player plays against an AI and can change some of the game options like the maximum characters each player is allowed, and the total turns before beginning the game. This game was a lot of fun to code and I hope that you’ll have fun playing it!
